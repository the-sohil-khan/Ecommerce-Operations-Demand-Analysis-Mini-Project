# Ecommerce-Operations-Demand-Analysis-Mini-Project
This project analyzes a real-world e-commerce dataset to evaluate delivery performance, seller efficiency, and demand trends using Python.

# 📦 E-Commerce Operations & Demand Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing a real-world e-commerce dataset to evaluate delivery performance, seller efficiency, and demand trends.
The objective is to support operations, logistics, and inventory planning decisions through data-driven insights.

The analysis follows an end-to-end data analytics workflow, from raw data processing to insight generation and visualization.

🎯 Business Objectives

* Evaluate on-time vs late delivery performance
* Identify sellers contributing to delivery delays
* Analyze high sales volume but low revenue scenarios
* Understand monthly and yearly demand trends for inventory planning

* **Libraries Used**

  * `matplotlib`
  * `seaborn`
  * `plotly`
  * `pandas`
  * `numpy`


## 📂 Dataset Description

The dataset contains multiple relational tables including:

* Orders
* Customers
* Sellers
* Products
* Payments
* Geolocation
Each table was cleaned and merged where required to enable operational and time-based analysis.


##🔍 Key Analysis Performed
* Data cleaning and preprocessing
* Feature engineering (delivery time, order trends)
* Multi-table joins and aggregations
* Seller-level performance analysis
* Time-series analysis for demand trends

KPI creation and business-focused visualizations

📈 Key Insights
* Over 90% of orders were delivered on time, indicating strong overall logistics performance
* A small group of sellers showed significantly higher late delivery rates, highlighting improvement opportunities
* Certain products exhibited high order volume but low revenue, suggesting pricing or margin inefficiencies
* Demand trends revealed clear monthly and yearly patterns, useful for inventory and capacity planning

## 🔗 Dataset & Project Files

* **Data Source :** Kaggle

## 🚀 Key Learnings

* While overall delivery performance was strong, a smaller portion of late deliveries and low-revenue high-volume products revealed clear opportunities for operational and pricing optimization. Demand trends also showed seasonal patterns that can support better inventory and capacity planning.
